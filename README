What is TylyOS?
================
TylyOS is a kernel for a lightweight and simple operating system, designed to be hosted in VMs
and to be used in environments in which memory and CPU footprints are the main concern.
It's geared towards developers who are seeking a way to test a program in a safe, and fast, way.
The project is currently being builded using a Linux toolchain, but we hope there will be a day
in which TylyOS will be able to build itself.
