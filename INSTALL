Compiling TylyOS
================
Run "make" in the kernel directory to compile TylyOS.

Running TylyOS
==============
Run "sh test" to run TylyOS using bochs.
Run "sh qtest" if you prefer qemu.

Clean up
========
Run "make clean" to clean up all the object and intermediate files.

Notes
=====
make clean *does* delete tylyos.iso
make smallclean is the same as make clean, but it does *not* delete tylyos.iso
