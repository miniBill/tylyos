Compiling ClearOS
========================================
Run "make" to compile ClearOS.
(If it's the first time you compile it you have to run "./configure")

Running ClearOS
===============
Run "sh test" to run ClearOS.

Clean up
========
Run "make clean" to clean up all the object and intermediate files.

Notes

make clean *does* delete iso.img
make smallclean is the same as make clean, but it does *not* delete iso.img
